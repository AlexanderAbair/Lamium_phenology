# *Lamium amplexicaule* phenology analysis
  Here are all my scripts for my test analysis of iNaturalist phenology data.
  The first steps are carried out in the r project in the root directory.
  Subsequent shell scripting using functions from ImageMagick is carried out in the plots subdirectory.
  Apologies if any of this is unintelligible, I'm new to r!
  Message me on any of my social media platforms if you have questions.<br/>
